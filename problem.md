Santander Customer Transaction Prediction
https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction:
problem: customers will make a specific transaction in the future
 * classification binary

I chose the **Santander Customer Transaction Prediction** challenge because it is a binary classification problem, I found the data a little different from what I usually work with, and as the main objective of this test is not related to machine learning modeling, I will use this challenge to learn project how structuring MLOps project.

## Database

The problem's question is, "Can you identify who will make a transaction?". The contextualization of the problem informs that the objective is to identify which customers will make a transaction.
The problem is sentiment analysis. The provided data has a label identified by the target column, which has a binary value (0 or 1) and must be the column used for inference.

Input data:
 * 200 raw features without description

Output data:
 * binary target column, 0 or 1.

## Solution

We have a model that will analyze customer sentiments and tell you which customers will transact in the future.

## How?

Since we are dealing with binary classification, I will implement a decision tree with the LightGBM library as an initial model to analyze the data.

The result will be a survey of a customer who will make transactions in the future.

# Metrics 

Metric: How many customers does the model predict correctly?
